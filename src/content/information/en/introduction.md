👋 Hi, welcome to my digital corner.

**Why Thought.Mosaic?**
Mosaic is not just an art form; it is a metaphor. In this space, every opinion and every entry serves as a tiny "tile." Viewed individually, they might just be a game walkthrough, a reflection on existentialism, or a photo of a handmade craft. But when cemented together by time, and viewed from a step back, they piece together the world as I see it, and the complete picture of who I am.

**🧠 Philosophy:**
Here, I document thoughts on "how to live," attempting to find inner peace in an uncertain world.

**🛠️ Crafting:**
Just hoping to leave a trace in this world.

**📚 Etc.:**
Photography, R&B music, and those useless but fascinating bits of trivia.
